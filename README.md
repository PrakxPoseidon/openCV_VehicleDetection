# Vehicle Detection Project

This project implements a vehicle detection system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to accurately identify and locate vehicles in images and video streams.


## Features

- Real-time Vehicle Detection: Detects cars, trucks, and other vehicles in real-time using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- Video Stream Processing: Processes video streams from files or live feeds to identify and highlight vehicles.
- Image Processing: Analyzes static images for vehicle detection.
- Bounding Box Visualization: Draws bounding boxes around detected vehicles for clear visualization.
- Customizable Parameters: Allows tuning of detection parameters to balance accuracy and performance.


## Installation

1)Clone the repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/PrakXPoseidon/openCV_VehicleDetection.git
```
2)Navigate to the project directory
```bash
  cd openCV_VehicleDetection
```

    
## Result
The results of the detection are saved in the output directory, with bounding boxes drawn around detected vehicles in images and videos.
